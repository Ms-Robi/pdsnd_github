### Steps on How to Use the Code

1. Download the CSV files for each city's bike share data: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv.
2. Place the CSV files in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and CSV files.
4. Run the script using the following command, python bikeshare_analysis.py
5. Follow the instructions in the terminal to select the city, month, and day of the week for analysis.
6. The script will display various statistics and insights about the bike share data based on your input.
7. After viewing the statistics, the script will prompt you to see individual trip data. Type "yes" or "no" to view or skip this option.
8. If you choose to see individual trip data, you can specify the number of rows to display at a time.
9. The script will continue asking if you want to view more trip data until you type "no."
10. After exploring the data, you can choose to restart the analysis or exit the program.
