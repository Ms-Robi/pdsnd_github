### Project Title
Bikeshare 

### Description
This Python script analyzes bike share data from three cities: Chicago, New York City and Washington. The user can input their preferred city, month, and day of the week to explore the data.

### Files used
Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3
pandas
numpy

### Important Notes
If you enter an invalid city, month, or day of the week, the script will prompt you to re-enter the information.

The script assumes that the CSV files have columns for "Start Time," "End Time," "Start Station," "End Station," "User Type," "Gender," and "Birth Year." If any of these columns are missing, the script will inform you that the information is not available.

The script uses the pandas library to load and manipulate the data, and the numpy library for numerical computations.

Make sure to check the terminal for any error messages or prompts while running the script.
